## Data processing

The TCGA manifest file used to download WSIs from TCGA is also here. Please check [this link](https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/Data_Transfer_Tool/Users_Guide/Data_Download_and_Upload/) for instructions on using this file. 

The file ```make_tiles.py``` was used to extract tiles from the downloaded WSI images using [OpenSlide](https://openslide.org/). ```tile_processing.py``` was generously provided by [Marvin Lerousseau](https://marvinler.github.io).
